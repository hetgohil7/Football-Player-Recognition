## Note on Player Recognition

This version of the app uses a predefined set of player data and randomly selects a player when an image is uploaded. In a production environment, this would be replaced with actual image recognition technology and a comprehensive player database.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual image recognition using machine learning models.
- Expand the player database to include more players and up-to-date statistics.
- Add search functionality to allow users to look up players without image upload.
- Implement user accounts to save favorite players or recognition history.
